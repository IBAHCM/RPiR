\title{Simplest code to plot population(s) against time}
\usage{
plot_simple(populations, new.graph = TRUE, xlim = NA, ylim = NA, lty = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{populations}{Data frame with columns corresponding to different
population segments and a 'time' column}

\item{new.graph}{(optionally) whether to start a new graph, default TRUE}

\item{xlim}{(optionally, for new graphs) the limits of the x axis,
default min to max time}

\item{ylim}{(optionally, for new graphs) the limits of the y axis,
default min to max pop size}

\item{lty}{(optionally) the line type for all lines on the graph,
default 1}
}
\description{
A simple plot all of the populations in a data frame against time. One column
must be called "time" and will be used as the x-axis of the plot. The rest
will be used as different lines on the y-axis, with a legend denoting their
column names. See plot_populations() above for a more sophisticated plotting
function.

\examples{

df <- data.frame(time=0:100, grow=exp((0:100) / 10),
                 die=exp(seq(10, 0, by = -0.1)))
plot_simple(df, lty = c(2, 3))

}
