# Reference materials

## British Ecological Society

The [British Ecological Society (BES)][BES] is the oldest ecological society in
the world, and one of the largest. It publishes [several excellent
journals][BES-journals], including [Methods in Ecology and Evolution][BES-MEE],
which publishes many software packages.

The society also provides many several [guides on better science][BES-guides].
As part of the course, **we require you to read the following guides**:

- [Reproducible Code][BES-repro]
- [Data Management][BES-data]

## Hadley Wickham

[Hadley Wickham][hadley-wickham] is the Chief Scientist for RStudio. He created
the original `ggplot` library for his PhD. These days his
[data analysis packages][tidyverse-packages] are collectively known as the
[tidyverse][tidyverse], the most famous of which are probably [ggplot2][ggplot2]
and [dplyr][dplyr]. He has written three very useful books on data analysis and
software development in R:

- [R for Data Science (R4DS)][R4DS]
  * [Solutions to the exercises][R4DS-solutions]
- Advanced R
  - [1st edition][advanced-r] (I find this easier to navigate)
    * [Solutions to the exercises][advanced-r-solutions]
  - [2nd edition][advanced-r2] (this is obviously updated)
    * [Solutions to the exercises][advanced-r2-solutions]
- [R Packages][r-packages]

We recommend all of these books as reference material, and will point to
specific chapters at time, but the books themselves are probably too long for
you to read in their entirety. Nonetheless keep them for future reference, as
they contain an enormous amount of knowledge about R in a (relatively!) compact
form.

## Assorted other materials

### Understanding, avoiding and fixing errors in your code

As part of the course, **we require you to watch [this
keynote][rstudioconf2020-jb]** from RStudio::Conf 2020 by [Jenny
Bryan][jenny-bryan] of RStudio. It is an excellent keynote on errors in R and
how to identify and fix them.

### Reproducible (and generally good) coding practices

There are many materials on reproducible research, including the BES guide
mentioned above. For background, we recommend watching [this short
clip][ted-repro] by Matt Anticole for TED-Ed. **We require you to read** [this
article on sharing code][nature-repro] and [this guide on good coding
practices][dataist-coding]. None of this was written specifically for R
programmers, but there are useful tips for everyone (and some specific to R).

### R cheatsheets

RStudio and other contributors provide a variety of [cheatsheets][rstudio-cheat]
that summarise functionality of a variety of different topics in R, including
markdown in reports, on RStudio itself, and everything from Base R to package
development to parallel computing in R. **The main cheatsheets are available
directly from RStudio under *Help -> Cheatsheets*.**

### R Markdown

R Markdown allows you to produce reports from your R code or, as RStudio put it,
to *"turn your analyses into high quality documents, reports, presentations and
dashboards."* As well as the cheatsheet and reference guide above, there are a
variety of resources for R Markdown:

- RStudio's [R Markdown website][rmd-rstudio], including:
  * [Pandoc's markdown website][rmd-pandoc], which describes the non-R parts of
    the format
- [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide][rmd-book] - an e-book by Yihui Xie, J. J.
  Allaire and Garrett Grolemund
  
These are great resources, and can help you to produce everything from the
simple reports you will be generating on this course, the lectures we are giving
and this website with the course documentation, to complex interactive [Shiny
apps][shiny-rstudio]. Like Hadley Wickham's books, they are probably references
you will refer to later more than during the course, but they are completely
comprehensive if you want to look anything up.

### R Coder

The [Learn R section][rcoder-learnr] of this website provides explanations for a
lot of common techniques that you use during this course in the *Programming*
section. If you are confused by our expalanations, you may find this useful.

# Specific techniques

## Loops

### `for` loops

We introduced `for (...)` loops in [Lecture 5b][lecture-5b] and practical
`practicalA-1`, and they are then used starting in practical `practical1-1`.
There is a section in R4DS (within a more general chapter on
[*Iteration*][R4DS-iteration]) that covers [`for` loops][for-R4DS] For loops
are also covered by R Coder [here][for-rcoder].

### `while` loops

We introduced `while (...)` loops in [Lecture 5b][lecture-5b] and
`practicalA-2`, and used them from practical `practical2-4`. There is a section
in R4DS (within a more general chapter on [*Iteration*][R4DS-iteration]) that
covers [`while` loops][while-R4DS]. While loops are also covered by R Coder
[here][while-rcoder].
