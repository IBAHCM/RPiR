This guide assumes you have a GitHub repository all set up. If you need help
doing that, there's another guide 
[here](https://ibahcm.github.io/RPiR/articles/pages/use_github.html) that will take you through it. 

Now click on the green <span style="color: #de77ae;">Code</span> button and 
**copy the URL** associated with your GitHub repository to your clipboard

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/use-github-04.png')
```

## Create a new RStudio project

In RStudio, click <span style="color: #de77ae;">File > New project...</span>, 
then since we're integrating version control into this project workflow, you 
should select <span style="color: #de77ae;">Version Control</span>.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/use-github-05.png')
```

Select the option to clone a project from a 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">Git</span> repository.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/use-github-06.png')
```

**Paste your Repository URL** into the first box, then click 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">Browse...</span> 
and navigate to the git folder on your desktop. If you don't have a git folder 
on your desktop then make one, as it's good practice to keep all of your 
projects together and well organised. RStudio will create a new subdirectory 
that will mirror the contents of your Git repository (so make sure you 
don't already have a folder with the same name as the repository you created, 
as this will cause problems). Now click 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">Create Project</span> and enter your GitHub 
username and password if you're asked.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/use-github-07.png')
```

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new RStudio project (now with
added version control). In the example below, (1) the RStudio project is called 
`soniamitchell_0201`, (2) a new directory, `soniamitchell_0201`, has been 
created, which is now your working directory, and inside this directory are (3) 
three files, including a GitHub `README.md` file (imported from your GitHub 
repository), an RStudio project file (`soniamitchell_0201.Rproj`), and an 
invisible `.gitignore` file (created by RStudio). 

Note the appearance of a new <span style="color: #de77ae;">Git</span> tab next 
to <span style="color: #de77ae;">Connections</span>. This is 
important.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/use-github-08.png')
```
