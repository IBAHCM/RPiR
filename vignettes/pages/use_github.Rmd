# GitHub

*for RStudio*

## Create a new GitHub repository

It's important that you use version control in your project workflow, so let's 
set up a new GitHub repository (you should make a new repository for each
project you're working on). To do this, click <span style="color: #de77ae;">New</span>

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/1-1.png')
```

Choose a short, descriptive name for your repository and 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">Initialize this repository with a README</span>. 

> When writing a package, it is good practice for the name of your repository to 
match the name of your package. So bear in mind that the name of a package 
"should contain only (ASCII) letters, numbers and dot, have at least two 
characters and start with a letter and not end in a dot"
([ref](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html)). Though very few
[package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html)
names include a dot.

Since this is a tutorial and not
a real project, this repository has been named `test`.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/1-2.png')
```

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new GitHub repository, 
containing a single `README.md` file. Remember this for later.

Now **copy** the URL associated with your GitHub repository to your clipboard

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/1-3.png')
```

## Create a new RStudio project

In RStudio, click <span style="color: #de77ae;">File > New project...</span>

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "20%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/2-1.png')
```

Since we're integrating version control into this project workflow, click 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">Version Control</span>

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/2-2.png')
```

Select the option to clone a project from a 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">Git</span> repository

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/2-3.png')
```

**Paste your Repository URL** into the first box, then click 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">Browse...</span> 
and navigate to the git folder on your desktop. If you don't have a git folder 
on your desktop then make one, as it's good practice to keep all of your 
projects together and well organised. RStudio will create a new subdirectory 
that will mirror the contents of your Git repository (so make sure you 
don't already have a folder with the same name as the repository you created, 
as this will cause problems). Now click 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">Create Project</span>

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/2-4.png')
```

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new RStudio project (now with
added version control). In the example below, the RStudio project is called 
`test`. A new directory, `test`, has been created inside the git folder on your 
desktop (this is now your working directory). Inside this directory are three 
files, including a GitHub `README.md` file (imported from your GitHub 
repository), an RStudio project file (`test.Rproj`), and an invisible 
`.gitignore` file (created by RStudio). 

Note the appearance of a new <span style="color: #de77ae;">Git</span> tab next 
to <span style="color: #de77ae;">Connections</span>. This is 
important.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/2-5.png')
```

## Using git in RStudio

Compare the contents of your working directory to the files listed in the
<span style="color: #de77ae;">Git</span> tab. The 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">Git</span> tab is a useful tool that shows you 
how your remote
directory (your GitHub repository) differs from your local directory 
(in this case `~Desktop/Git/test`). Currently, the `README.md` file in your 
local directory is identical to the one in your remote directory. That's why 
you can't see it in the <span style="color: #de77ae;">Git</span> tab. Instead,
`.gitignore` and `test.Rproj`
are listed with yellow **Status** question marks. What do these icons mean?

* "?" - Files or directories that don't currently exist in your git repository 
(you either want to commit these or add them to `.gitignore`)
* "A" - Files that have been staged and are ready to commit (you're in the 
process of committing these)
* "M" - Files that are modified versions of those in the repository (you 
definately want to commit these)
* "D" - Files that are no longer in your local directory (you want to
commit these to GitHub)

Open the `README.md` file by clicking on its filename in the 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">Files</span> tab. 
Does this look familiar? (Compare the contents of this file to your
repository on GitHub)

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/2-6.png')
```

Usually a GitHub README (written in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github)) will describe the 
contents of the GitHub repository or give an example of how to use the contents 
of said repository. Make some edits to `README.md` and **save** your file. Note 
that when we make edits to the README file, its **Status** changes to "M". This 
means that the file in your local directory is no longer identical to the file 
in your remote directory (on GitHub).

Click <span style="color: #de77ae;">Commit</span> to upload these changes to GitHub.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/2-7.png')
```

The <span style="color: #de77ae;">RStudio: Review Changes</span> window has 
opened. Click on the <span style="color: #de77ae;">Staged</span>
checkbox next to `README.md` and enter a 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">Commit message</span>. Your message 
should describe the changes you've made to the file you're uploading (in this
case, an initial commit). These changes are shown in the lower half of the 
screen, with deletions and insertions highlighted in red and green, 
respectively. Click <span style="color: #de77ae;">Commit</span> to continue.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/3-1.png')
```

Congratulations! `README.md` is now staged, with 7 insertions and 1 deletion. 
**Close** this window.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/3-2.png')
```

Then <span style="color: #de77ae;">Push</span> all staged files (at the moment, just `README.md`) to GitHub.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/3-3.png')
```

You'll need to enter your password..

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/3-4.png')
```

Congratulations again! You've successfully pushed these changes to GitHub. 
**Close** this window and the **Review Changes** window beneath it.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/3-5.png')
```

Note that `README.md` is no longer listed in the 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">Git</span> tab (because both the
local and remote versions are identical).

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/4-1.png')
```

... and the GitHub README is immediately updated. 

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/github/4-2.png')
```

## Final remarks

RStudio offers integrated version control, which is useful for *daily tasks*
such as pushing, pulling, and reviewing changes (click on 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">Diff</span> in the 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">Git</span> tab). However, this is just the tip of 
the iceberg. If you have time, 
why not take a look at the links below. Try the interactive tutorials in 
"Learn Git Branching" by Peter Cottle and experiment in RStudio's **Terminal** 
tab with your own repository.
