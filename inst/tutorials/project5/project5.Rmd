## Overview

*So far, we have been using the true counts of our real (and imagined)
populations. Ordinarily we have only a small proportion, a sample, of this data. 
We will now investigate how much it matters if we only have a small sample of 
data to work with rather than the whole picture.*

## Background

Usually we are not in the happy situation of having a massive dataset and only 
wanting to look at part of it, but in fact it is not as rare an event as you 
might think. In this context, it turns out that some diversity measures are very 
sensitive to the amount of data that has been collected, and so if you want to 
compare two populations to identify the more diverse, you may need to subsample 
the larger dataset to the size of the smaller to make a fair comparison.

## Tasks

There are several ways of subsampling a population like we have here. The 
simplest way to **approximate** the process is to use `rmultinom()` to generate 
a small dataset with appropriate probabilities as we did in Project 1 to create 
`rand.pop`. Switch to your BCI data package, and write and document a function 
(putting it alongside the `sample_by_species`, etc.) to subsample a dataset to a 
given size called `sample_by_individuals` (perhaps using this `rmultinom` 
function) â€“ it can take a vector of population counts and a sample size as its 
arguments and return a vector of sample counts. Note this is slightly different 
from the other `sample_xxx` functions that I provided that take the whole 
`bci_2010` dataset as an argument (a matrix, not a vector). That's absolutely 
fine.

Once you're happy with it, commit the changes and push them to GitHub. If you 
want to, you can get your collaborator to check it over (only this package, not 
your project as a whole), but you are under no obligation to do so. Make sure 
the rest of that package is correct, with all of the documentation, etc. looking 
good, as this is the version of that package that I will be assessing for 
Practical 1.

Incidentally, can you work out why this is only an approximation? Can you think 
of a better solution? This is not easy (or I can't see how to do it easily 
anyway!), so don't worry if you just use the suggested method. If you can work 
out what's wrong, put an explanation into the documentation for the function.

## Running the code / Report

Now go back to the project / package you have been using for these current 
exercises and create a new report script. For each dataset in turn that has the 
full number of individuals in (*i.e.* not `quadrat.pop`, `quadrat10.pop` or 
`rand50.pop`), plot the diversity profile of the full dataset, and then plot the 
diversity profile of a subsample of 10 individuals, then 100, 1000, 10000, etc. 
until you reach the full population size. See what effect sample size has on 
diversity for different values of q. At this point you have two choices:

**Either** (a more qualitative, graphical project) look at plots of the full 
dataset, and then multiple repeats of, say, 100 or 1000 individuals and see how 
variable your answers are with small samples, investigating issues arising from 
not collecting enough data in as much detail as you like...

**Or alternatively** (a more analytical project) you could choose to run 
analyses on the different populations and subsamples of them, and then repeat 
the same analyses on the exact same populations and subsamples using our 
`rdiversity` package and compare the results numerically (as in Project 3, 
remember that you can test whether two numbers are approximately equal to each 
other using `if (abs(x-y) < 0.000001)`) to ensure they give the same results.
