set.seed(123)
```

## Overview

*In this practical we will learn how to create an R package.*

## Background

For more information, follow this [link](https://r-pkgs.org).

## Tasks

We have written a function that will generate an R package for you to 
look at. In the following example, we have set 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">~/Desktop/git</span> as our working directory
(this is where we keep all of our projects) and run `dummy_package()`, without 
any arguments. 

A new instance of RStudio should open:

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/package.png')
```

You should find that (1) your working directory is now 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">package0301</span>, (2) inside this directory
are a number of files and directories, and (3) an RStudio project has been set 
up, called <span style="color: #de77ae;">package0301</span>. 

Of the three files, two 
should be familiar to you. These are your script and step function from 
Practical 1-5. The third file, 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">project0201.Rproj</span>, is an RStudio project
file, which can be used as a shortcut for opening this project from your 
filesystem.
