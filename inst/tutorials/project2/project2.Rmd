## Overview

*There is a general series of measures of diversity, which is defined as 
follows:

$$D_q = \left( \sum_{i \in \{1 \dots N_S, p_i \neq 0\}} p_i^q \right)^{\frac{1}{1-q}}$$

where $N_s$ is the number of species that we have observed at least one of, and
$pi_$ is the proportion of individuals that are in the $i^{th}$ species. $D^q$ 
is then the $q^{th}$ diversity measure.

We can translate this general measure easily into more specific measures (such 
as the ones we looked at in Project 1), by setting q to different values. In 
this exercise, we will write a function to calculate this general diversity
measure, and then rewrite the specific functions so they use the general one.*

## Background

Hill developed a unifying series of diversity measures in 1973 that were 
closely related to most existing measures (Hill, M. O. (1973) Diversity and
evenness: a unifying notation and its consequences. *Ecology*, 54, 427–432) but 
had a firm mathematical footing, being based on a measure called the Rényi 
Entropy (A. Rényi (1961). On measures of information and entropy. *Proceedings
of the 4th Berkeley Symposium on Mathematics, Statistics and Probability 1960*,
pp. 547–561). These have been slightly adapted into the equation above by Lou 
Jost (Jost, L. (2006) Entropy and diversity. *Oikos*, 113, 363– 375) to give a 
series of measures of the **effective number of species**. You are very likely 
to be unfamiliar with at least some of the notation of the equation. That's 
fine -- it says:

> "For the qth diversity measure, take the non-zero species proportions (note – proportions, so they all sum to 1, not counts), and raise them each (individually) to the power q. Then add all of the results together, and finally raise the sum to the power 1/(1-q)."

This measure always gives a result between 1 and $N_s$, where $N_s$ is the 
total number of species. Where one species completely dominates and the others 
are not observed we will see "effectively" only 1 species, and where all 
species are exactly equally abundant, we will count them all equally, and 
effectively see the full $N_s$ species. Other species distributions will fall 
somewhere in between. The species richness of a population is $D^0$, and the 
Simpson diversity of a population is $\frac{1}{D^2}$.

## Tasks

Write a function that takes a set of population counts and a value $q$ as 
arguments and calculates the $q^{th}$ diversity measure of the counts. Remember 
that the equation described above uses the species proportions, not the counts 
themselves.

Now write two more new functions to calculate species richness and Simpson 
diversity that do almost no work themselves, but instead just call this first 
function to do the work with the right arguments, and then transform the
results if necessary as detailed above -- this is just like 
`plot_populations()` in the ProgInR package, which does some work and then 
calls `plot()`, or `cleanup_timesteps()`, which calls `cleanup_times()`, 
rather than calculating the values directly in the function like you did in
Project 1. Note the functions you write here should produce exactly the same
answers as the functions you wrote in the previous exercise when called with 
the same argument.

## Running the code

Run the three functions on the populations provided and check that your results 
are identical to the original functions (though the diversity of `rand.pop`, 
`quadrat.pop` and `quadrat10.pop` will only be the same if you use the same 
random set of values / run them at the same time!). Remember that to run both 
sets of functions in the same script you will need to make sure that the 
functions have different names or they will overwrite one another.

You will almost certainly find that `one.pop` now has a different species 
richness (if not, then well done though!). This is probably because you are not 
looking only at the non-zero species abundances. If so, rewrite your code to 
exclude zeros from the proportions... Hint: remember that `a[a < 3]` will 
return those elements of a vector a which are less than 3.

Note that here, and throughout these exercises, if you want to -- it's not
compulsory – you can check the values of the diversity function itself by 
loading in the `rdiversity` library, and then creating a metacommunity from a 
population and calculating its metacommunity gamma diversity with the right 
values of the `qs` argument.

## Report

Write a script that loads in the function files from both Project 1 and this 
exercise (or loads the library you have written) and shows that they generate 
the same results for $q = 0$ (Species richness) and $q = 2$
(Simpson diversity). Again, your function code should be documented, so build a 
report for that file too (or build the documentation for the package).

### Important note
Please remember the order of calculations (*i.e.* BODMAS – or that's the name I
was taught), so:

$$
a^{\frac{b}{c+d}} \neq \frac{a^b}{c}+d \neq \frac{a^b}{c+d} \neq a^{\frac{b}{c}}+d \neq a^{\frac{b}{c}+d}
$$

A reminder is in the maths intro you did on the first day of the course. If you 
do things in the wrong order you could get any of the above. Generally, if you
have an equation then do the things that are grouped most tightly together first
(within clusters or brackets do the raising to the power first, then the
multiplication and division, then the addition and subtraction). So in this 
case you calculate $c+d$ because they are on a line of their own, then
$\frac{b}{c+d}$ because they cluster together, and only then 
$a^{\frac{b}{c+d}}$. Or you can just use brackets in the right places to do it 
all in one go if you're confident:

$$a^{\left( \frac{b}{(c+d)} \right)}$$

If in doubt, check it by calculating the intermediate bits by hand or with a 
calculator and then compare it with your final answer.
