## Overview

*In this practical we start to run a stochastic version of the SIR model.*

## Background

Having created our stochastic version of the SIS model in the previous practical
we are now ready to extend this framework to the SIR model.

## Tasks

Using the code from the previous practical 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">0303-run-SIS.r</span> and
<span style="color: #de77ae;">0303-stochastic-SIS.r</span>, create two new files 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">0304-run-SIR.r</span> and
<span style="color: #de77ae;">0304-stochastic-SIR.r</span> that will simulate
the stochastic SIR model.

This should be relatively straightforward. To produce 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">0304-run-SIR.r</span> you need to add a 
"recovereds" population to the data frame, remembering to specify 
initial values for this new population.

To produce <span style="color: #de77ae;">0304-stochastic-SIR.r</span> requires 
a small change to the update step
to move the newly recovered individuals into the recovered class rather than 
back into the susceptible class. Remember also to include the recovereds in the
population size calculation.

To overlay the corresponding plot from the deterministic model you will also 
need to use `run_simulation()` on the `timestep_deterministic_SIR()` function 
from Practical 2-4, and then plot using `new.graph = FALSE`.

## Running the code / Report

Run the code for different values of beta, initial conditions, and the
population size. Why do the plots of the stochastic simulation end before those
of the deterministic simulation? What happens as you increase the population 
size?

Write a report demonstrating some of these effects.

Now try increasing the transmission rate to increase the value of $R_0$. Given 
a default value for the recovery rate of 0.1 what would beta need to be to 
simulate an outbreak with an $R_0$ of 15? What happens when you do this when the
time step is 1? You should get an error message saying the time step is too
large. You may still get a plot though! This is because R is plotting the 
previous value of populations held in its memory. This is why it's important to 
be aware of your workspace and clear your previous history when you're working 
on a new project (don't use `rm(list=ls())` though!) 

> Remember that generating a report starts a new copy of R and so is a much 
better check of whether the script can run on its own.

Clear what is held in Râ€™s workspace in RStudio. Now rerun with $R_0 = 15$ and 
confirm that you don't get an output when the error message shows. Remember
that clearing your workspace and trying again is often a very useful trick when
you get unexpected results.
