# Plan for today

## Get everything installed

First, go to https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=23343 and follow the
instructions there to make sure you have an up-to-date version of R and RStudio.

The last part of the installation instructions is to go to the GitHub site at
https://github.com/IBAHCM/RPiR and install the course itself from the
instructions there.

## Read the other materials

Moodle has some links to other materials to read or watch when you finish
installing everything.
