## Measures of Diversity


$$D_q = \left( \sum_{i \in \{1 \dots N_S, p_i \neq 0\}} p_i^q \right)^{\frac{1}{1-q}}$$

Covers all of these measures.

## Measures of Diversity

- Species richness
  - Number of species actually present
- Simpson diversity
  - Chance of two individuals being the same species
- Shannon entropy
  - Surprise in seeing next individual
- Berger-Parker
  - Evenness / Dominance of most abundant species

## Measures of Diversity

- Species richness
  - $D_0$
- Simpson diversity
  - $\frac{1}{D_2}$
- Shannon entropy
  - $log(D_1)$
- Berger-Parker
  - $\frac{1}{D_\infty}$

## Measures of Diversity

- $D_0$
  - Species richness
- $D_1$
  - exp(Shannon entropy)
- $D_2$
  - 1 / Simpson diversity

## Useful R

- `sort()` to sort a vector into ascending order
- `rep()`
- `barplot()`
- `rmultinom()` to generate multinomially distributed samples
- `Inf`
- `lines()`
