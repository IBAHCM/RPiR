## Overview

*In this practical we start to run a stochastic version of the SIR model.*

## Background

Having created our stochastic version of the SIS model in the previous practical
we are now ready to extend this framework to the SIR model.

## Tasks

Using the code from the previous demo 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">d0304_run_SIS</span> and
`timestep_stochastic_SIS()` (from Practical 3-4), create two a new demo 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">d0305_run_SIR</span> and a new function,
`timestep_stochastic_SIR()` that will simulate
the stochastic SIR model.

### R/timestep_stochastic_SIR.R

To produce `timestep_stochastic_SIR()` requires a small change to the update step
to move the newly recovered individuals into the recovered class rather than 
back into the susceptible class. Remember also to include the recovereds in the
population size calculation.

To overlay the corresponding plot from the deterministic model you will also 
need to use `run_simulation()` on the `timestep_deterministic_SIR()` function 
from Practical 2-5, and then plot using `new.graph = FALSE`.

### demo/d0305_run_SIR.R

This should be relatively straightforward. To produce 
<span style="color: #de77ae;">d0305_run_SIR</span> you need to add a 
"recovereds" population to the data frame, remembering to specify 
initial values for this new population.

Your outputs should look something like this:

This example was generated from these parameters:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pop.size <- 100
initial.infecteds <- 2
initial.recovereds <- 0
sir.transmission.rate <- 0.2
sir.recovery.rate <- 0.1
```

## Running the code / Report

Run the code for different values of beta, initial conditions, and the
population size. Why do the plots of the stochastic simulation end before those
of the deterministic simulation? What happens as you increase the population 
size?

Illustrate some of these effects in your demo.

Now try increasing the transmission rate to increase the value of $R_0$. Given 
a default value for the recovery rate of 0.1 what would the transmission rate
need to be to  simulate an outbreak with an $R_0$ of 15? What happens when you
do this when the time step is 1? You should get an error message saying the
timestep is too large. You may still get a plot though! This is because R is
plotting the  previous value of populations held in its memory. This is why it's
important to  be aware of your workspace and clear your previous history when
you're working on a new project (don't use `rm(list=ls())` though!) .

> Remember that generating a report starts a new copy of R and so is a much 
better check of whether the script can run on its own.

Clear what is held in Râ€™s workspace in RStudio. Now rerun with $R_0 = 15$ and 
confirm that you don't get an output when the error message shows. Remember
that clearing your workspace and trying again is often a very useful trick when
you get unexpected results.

## Check it works

As with previous exercises, you need to check that everything works correctly --
that the package installs, and the demos and help files work and you can
generate reports from the demos -- and then we want you to get a couple of other
people in your breakout room to check your code and make sure it works for them,
and we want you to check other people's code too. We describe how to do this for
packages in GitHub in Practical 3-1 (also under *Check it works*) if you're
uncertain.

*Remember, interacting like this through GitHub to help each other will count as
most of your engagement marks for the course.*
