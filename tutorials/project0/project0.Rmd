## Overview

In this series of practicals you will develop the code to calculate diversity
measures. You will have to choose the names of functions and variables in your 
code for yourself, and structure it appropriately, though some small amounts of
guidance will be given.

Remember that these practicals constitute the "project" part of the course, 
which constitutes 50% of the marks, so well-structured and well-commented code, 
and clear reports of the results, are very important. Any of the in-course 
exercises that you haven't finished by the end of the course should be 
completed in your own time.

## R packages and GitHub

Any work you do must be written as an R package and pushed to a GitHub 
repository. Please make your repository private and add (just) me as a 
collaborator. You must commit a change at least at the end of each
exercise (*i.e.* Project 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) with sensible commit messages stating 
what you have just done. You are welcome to do more commits if this is useful 
to you, and it's completely okay (and indeed normal) if you go back to earlier
exercises and make further edits and commit them after completing later 
exercises.
