<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Practical 3-1: Writing an R package</h1>

</div>


<div id="section-overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><em>In this practical we will learn how to create an R package. There is much more information on R packages in <a href="https://r-pkgs.org">this book</a>.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="section-tasks" class="section level2">
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>We’re now going to create an R package, in RStudio. To do this, click <span style="color: #de77ae;">File &gt; New project… &gt; New Directory &gt; R Package</span>. Name the package <code>githubusernameSeries03</code> (replacing <code>githubusername</code> with your actual GitHub username), check the box next to <span style="color: #de77ae;">Create a git repository</span> (and next to <span style="color: #de77ae;">Open in new session</span> if you are running this practical in RStudio and don’t want it to close), then click on <span style="color: #de77ae;">Create Project</span>.</p>
<p><img src="images/1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>You should find that (1) a new RStudio project has been created called <span style="color: #de77ae;">githubusernameSeries03</span>, (2) your working directory is now <span style="color: #de77ae;">githubusernameSeries03</span>, and (3) inside this directory are a number of files and directories:</p>
<p><img src="images/2.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We’ll explore some of these files in due course. In the mean time, <span style="color: #de77ae;">commit</span> all of the files with a nice descriptive comment.</p>
<p><img src="images/3.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We’ve changed 7 files and made 68 insertions.</p>
<p><img src="images/4.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>But we can’t push! Oh no! The little green <span style="color: #de77ae;">Push</span> button is dull and lifeless.</p>
<p><img src="images/5.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>First close that <span style="color: #de77ae;">hello.R</span> tab. We don’t need it, but it was automatically generated by <code>usethis::create_package()</code> (which was called by RStudio when you selected <span style="color: #de77ae;">File &gt; New project… &gt; New Directory &gt; R Package</span>).</p>
<p>Now, we need to set up a GitHub repository and while there are a number of ways to do this, the easiest way to connect an existing project to GitHub is by running this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>usethis::use_github(organisation = &quot;IBAHCM&quot;, private = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>This process will automatically edit your <span style="color: #de77ae;">DESCRIPTION</span> file and ask whether it’s OK to commit these changes, so just say yes, and your GitHub repository should open automatically in a window in your browser.</p>
<p>We don’t have a README yet, so click <span style="color: #de77ae;">Add a README</span> and type something nice in your README file (in your browser), then scroll down and <span style="color: #de77ae;">Commit new file</span>. Your GitHub repository should now look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/6.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>and RStudio should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/7.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Note the little green <span style="color: #de77ae;">Push</span> arrow is now vibrant and clickable because we’re connected to GitHub. Which reminds me, there’s still one more thing to do. We need to figure out how to pull that <span style="color: #de77ae;">README.md</span> file from GitHub to our computer. We can do this by clicking on the blue <span style="color: #de77ae;">Pull</span> arrow. When you do this, you should see that the <span style="color: #de77ae;">README.md</span> file has appeared in your working directory, with contents matching what you wrote on GitHub.</p>
<p><img src="images/8.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now we’re going to do a few things to customise your package. To fast forward through these steps run <code>RPiR::populate_package()</code>. There are some deletions (of example code, for instance) as well as additions (of code from the first practical series). Now push all of the changes to GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-package-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>Package structure</h2>
<p>We’re ready now to see what this package does. So first, we need to install it on your machine. Make sure you’re in the root directory of your package (if you’ve been following these instructions you probably are), and run</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install()</code></pre>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>devtools::</code> tells R to look for the <code>install()</code> function inside the <code>devtools</code> package. It is equivalent to calling <code>library(devtools)</code> and then just calling <code>install()</code> directly; and</li>
<li>you don’t need to specify a file path if you’re in the working directory of your package (which you are), see <code>?install</code> for details.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point your RStudio session should look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/9.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>and you should have the following files in your working directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #de77ae;">.gitignore</span>: contains regular expressions that should be ignored by Git, more info <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-use-gitignore-file">here</a></li>
<li><span style="color: #de77ae;">.Rbuildignore</span>: contains regular expressions that should be ignored by R CMD check / when building the package from source, more info <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/package-structure-state.html#rbuildignore">here</a></li>
<li><span style="color: #de77ae;">demo/</span>: contains R demo files, more info <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/misc.html#demo">here</a> (which we’ve populated with <span style="color: #de77ae;">d0105_run_birth_death.R</span>, the script from Practical 1-5)</li>
<li><span style="color: #de77ae;">DESCRIPTION</span>: contains metadata about your package, more info <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/description.html">here</a></li>
<li><span style="color: #de77ae;">man/</span>: contains code used to generate documentation when the package is built (don’t edit these files, this process will be automated), more info <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/man.html#man-workflow">here</a></li>
<li><span style="color: #de77ae;">NAMESPACE</span>: contains the names of imported and exported functions (don’t edit this file either), more info <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/namespace.html#namespace">here</a></li>
<li><span style="color: #de77ae;">R/</span>: contains code used to generate functions when the package is built (which we’ve populated with <span style="color: #de77ae;">step_deterministic_birth_death.R</span>, the step function from Practical 1-5), more info <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/r.html#code-organising">here</a></li>
<li><span style="color: #de77ae;">README.md</span>: contains markdown used to generate your GitHub repository readme page, more info <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes">here</a></li>
<li><span style="color: #de77ae;">githubusername.Rproj</span>: an RStudio project file, which is used to make this directory an RStudio project, and can be used as a shortcut for opening this project from your filesystem, more info <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects">here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to explore these files and make sure you have a good grasp of what they do.</p>
<div id="section-package-documentation" class="section level3">
<h3>Package documentation</h3>
<p>Look at the package documentation by using the <code>help()</code> function, or running:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(githubusername) 
?githubusername</code></pre>
<p>This documentation was generated from <span style="color: #de77ae;">R/githubusernameSeries03-package.R</span>. Open this file and compare its contents with the documentation generated in RStudio. Go ahead and edit the <code>@author</code> field. This is your package now.</p>
<p>Remember that any changes you make to the package documentation won’t yet be visible. You need to run <code>devtools::document()</code> to recompile the documentation and <code>devtools::install()</code> to permanently install them as part of your package.</p>
<p>Note that if you scroll to the bottom of the help function and click on <span style="color: #de77ae;">Index</span> you’ll get a list of functions exported by this package.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-demo" class="section level3">
<h3>Demo</h3>
<p>Try running the demo:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>demo(topic = &quot;d0105_run_birth_death&quot;, package = &quot;githubusernameSeries03&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>As you can see in <span style="color: #de77ae;">demo/d0301_run_birth_death.R</span>, this is just a standard script.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The important thing to note here is that you no longer need to <code>source()</code> files, since any functions you need to use can be installed as part of the package.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calling <code>demo(package = "githubusernameSeries03")</code> lists all of the demos installed as part of the <code>githubusername</code> package.</p>
<p>Note the <span style="color: #de77ae;">demo/00Index</span> file, which is lists each demo alongside a description, on a single line. When adding a new entry, remember to put three spaces between the demo name and its description or you won’t see it in the demo list.</p>
<p>Any script in the <span style="color: #de77ae;">demo</span> directory that is listed in the <span style="color: #de77ae;">demo/00Index</span> file can be run using <code>demo()</code> (after the package is installed). So don’t forget when you add your own demos, you need to run <code>devtools::install()</code> to permanently install them as part of your package.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-function-documentation" class="section level3">
<h3>Function documentation</h3>
<p>The functions themselves are stored in the <span style="color: #de77ae;">R</span> directory. Open <span style="color: #de77ae;">R/step_deterministic_birth_death.R</span> and take a look. Everything above the function is converted by the <code>roxygen2</code> package into documentation. You might see <code>#'</code> referred to as an <code>roxygen</code> comment, more info <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html">here</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#&#39; step_deterministic_birth_death
#&#39;
#&#39; Run one step of a simple deterministic exponential birth-death model
#&#39;
#&#39; @param latest a data.frame containing the latest population count
#&#39; (column is &#39;count&#39;)
#&#39; @param birth.rate the birth rate
#&#39; @param death.rate the death rate
#&#39;
#&#39; @return Returns a data.frame containing the updated population
#&#39; @export
#&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Run <code>?step_deterministic_birth_death</code> to look at the help file for <code>step_deterministic_birth_death()</code> and compare it to the <code>roxygen</code> comments you see in the file.</p>
<p>When you add your own function to a package, after having written the <code>roxygen2</code> comments, you should run <code>devtools::document()</code> to generate the <span style="color: #de77ae;">man/</span> files and edit the <span style="color: #de77ae;">NAMESPACE</span>. You should then run <code>devtools::install()</code> to permanently install them as part of your package.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-package-metadata-and-dependencies" class="section level3">
<h3>Package metadata and dependencies</h3>
<p>Open the <span style="color: #de77ae;">DESCRIPTION</span> file. It should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Package: soniamitchellSeries03
Type: Package
Title: What the Package Does (Title Case)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Who wrote it
Maintainer: The package maintainer &lt;yourself@somewhere.net&gt;
Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
Use four spaces when indenting paragraphs within the Description.
License: What license is it under?
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
URL: https://github.com/IBAHCM/soniamitchellSeries03
BugReports: https://github.com/IBAHCM/soniamitchellSeries03/issues
Imports: 
RPiR (&gt;= 0.56.0),
Remotes: 
IBAHCM/RPiR
RoxygenNote: 7.1.1</code></pre>
<p>This file is used to record package dependencies (that is, packages that your package needs to work). Most typically, package y will be a dependency of package x if the functions in package y are being used by the functions in package x. In which case you would need to make it explicit within the functions of package x where the dependencies are (we’re not doing this just yet so don’t worry). See <a href="https://ibahcm.github.io/RPiR/articles/pages/packages_guide.html#add-dependencies">here</a> for details.</p>
<p>However, we do use the <code>RPiR</code> package in our demo, so I’ve added a dependency on <code>RPiR</code>. This was done by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Adding an entry in the <code>Imports</code> field of the <span style="color: #de77ae;">DESCRIPTION</span> file, <em>i.e.</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>Imports: 
RPiR</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Adding an <code>@import</code> in the <span style="color: #de77ae;">githubusername-package.R</span> file (located in the <span style="color: #de77ae;">R</span> directory), like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#&#39; @import RPiR</code></pre>
<p>In this particular case, the <code>RPiR</code> package is not available on CRAN, so we’ve had to note its location in the <code>Remotes</code> field as well as the <code>Imports</code> field.</p></li>
<li><p>Run <code>devtools::document()</code> to populate the <span style="color: #de77ae;">NAMESPACE</span> file (which you should never edit by hand)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As well as recording dependencies, the <span style="color: #de77ae;">DESCRIPTION</span> file contains various metadata such as the package <code>Title</code>, <code>Authors@R</code>, and <code>Description</code>. Fill those in now.</p>
<p>Whenever you make a change to your package, you should try to get into the habit of changing the version number. This is important because it allows you to keep track of which version of the code is being used for a particular analysis. The format is usually <strong>major.minor.patch</strong>, more info <a href="https://semver.org">here</a>.</p>
<p>After making edits to the <span style="color: #de77ae;">DESCRIPTION</span> file, change the <span style="color: #de77ae;">Version</span> number to <code>0.1.0</code>.</p>
<p>Then run <code>devtools::document()</code> to recompile the documentation and <code>devtools::install()</code> to permanently install these changes as part of your package.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-prepare-for-practical-3-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Prepare for Practical 3-2</h2>
<p>Now that you have some familiarity with the package structure, it’s time to start adding your own files. During the course of this practical series, you’ll be adding new functions and new demos to this package. What we’re going to do now is add the files you need to start Practical 3-2.</p>
<div id="section-add-a-function" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Add a function</h3>
<p>Navigate back to the root of your package, then into the <span style="color: #de77ae;">R</span> directory, and open the <span style="color: #de77ae;">step_deterministic_birth_death.R</span> file in a new tab.</p>
<p>The function itself should be recognizable, but the documentation is written using <code>roxygen2</code> comments and tags. More info <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/man.html#man-workflow">here</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#&#39; step_deterministic_birth_death
#&#39;
#&#39; Run one step of a simple deterministic exponential birth-death model
#&#39;
#&#39; @param latest a data.frame containing the latest population count
#&#39; (column is &#39;count&#39;)
#&#39; @param birth.rate the birth rate
#&#39; @param death.rate the death rate
#&#39;
#&#39; @return Returns a data.frame containing the updated population
#&#39; @export
#&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The first line is the name of your function and will generate the <span style="color: #de77ae;">title</span> when you run <code>?step_deterministic_birth_death</code>. The next bit (seperated by a blank line) is the <span style="color: #de77ae;">Description</span>. To add descriptions for arguments, you need to use the <code>@param</code> tag, which uses the format <code>@param argument description</code>. The <code>@return</code> tag is used to populate the <span style="color: #de77ae;">Value</span> section of the documentation, and describes the output of your function. The <code>@export</code> tag tells R that you want this function to be exportable by your package. That means, you want people to be able to call it, as opposed to it being an internal function they never see. I like to add blank lines between some of the tags and between the documentation and the function itself, because I think it makes it easier to read, but it’s not necessary.</p>
<p>So, for Practical 3-2 you’ll need to add a function called <span style="color: #de77ae;">timestep_stochastic_birth_death</span> with appropriate documentation. Copy the <span style="color: #de77ae;">step_deterministic_birth_death</span> function for the time being, renamed of course. You’ll be using this as a starting point in Practical 3-2.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-add-a-demo" class="section level3">
<h3>2. Add a demo</h3>
<p>Use the <span style="color: #de77ae;">Files</span> tab to navigate to the <span style="color: #de77ae;">demo</span> directory. This is where the demos live. Open the <span style="color: #de77ae;">00Index</span> and <span style="color: #de77ae;">d0105_run_birth_death.R</span> files as new tabs.</p>
<p>You can see that <span style="color: #de77ae;">d0105_run_birth_death.R</span> is a standard R file, similar to those you produced in practical series 2. So, all we need to do to prepare for Practical 3-2 is create a new R script called <span style="color: #de77ae;">d0302_stochastic_birth_death.R</span> and save it in the <span style="color: #de77ae;">demo</span> directory. Copy the contents of <span style="color: #de77ae;">d0105_run_birth_death.R</span> into your new demo. You’ll be using this as a starting point in Practical 3-2.</p>
<p>On line 30, edit the function call so that you’re calling <code>timestep_stochastic_birth_death</code> rather than <code>step_deterministic_birth_death()</code>.</p>
<p>So that your package recognizes it as a demo, you need to add a new entry, on a new line in the <span style="color: #de77ae;">00Index</span> file.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-rebuild-your-package" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Rebuild your package</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve created a new demo and function, you need to run <code>devtools::document()</code> from the root directory of your package to recompile the documentation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that unless you’ve explicitly used <code>setwd()</code> or clicked <code>Set As Working Directory</code>, you won’t have moved. Your working directory stays the same regardless of what you do in the <span style="color: #de77ae;">Files</span> tab.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then you need to run <code>devtools::install()</code>, again from the root directory of your package to permanently install these changes (as part of your package).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-check-it-works" class="section level2">
<h2>Check it works</h2>
<div id="section-a.-check-it-works-for-yourself" class="section level3">
<h3>A. Check it works for yourself</h3>
<p>To check it works:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Run <code>demo(package = "githubusernameSeries03")</code> to check your new demo is listed;</li>
<li>Try running your demo with <code>demo("d0302_stochastic_birth_death.R", package = "githubusernameSeries03")</code>;</li>
<li>Run <code>?timestep_stochastic_birth_death</code> to check your new function has documentation; and</li>
<li>Compile an html report from the demo to make sure that the report works too.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully you’ve been making regular pushes to GitHub.</p>
<p>Now just like you did in Practical series 2, add an issue to your repository and ask the people in your breakout room to check your work.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-b.-check-it-works-for-other-people" class="section level3">
<h3>B. Check it works for other people</h3>
<p>There are two ways you can check a package:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>First, just install it! They should just call <code>install_github()</code> as you would for <code>RPiR</code>, and find out what demos are available and run them:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># Install your colleague&#39;s package
devtools::install_github(&quot;IBAHCM/githubusernameSeries03&quot;)

# Find out what demos are available:
demo(package = &quot;githubusernameSeries03&quot;)

# Run the demos, e.g.:
demo(&quot;d0302_stochastic_birth_death.R&quot;, package = &quot;githubusernameSeries03&quot;)</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If you have time, then create a new project from their GitHub repository (we talked about this in the <em>Sharing is caring</em> section of practical 2-1), and make sure that the html reports can be generated when you open the demo files and compile them directly.
