## Overview

So far, we have been using the true counts of our real (and imagined)
populations. Ordinarily we only have a small proportion, a sample, of this data. 
We will now investigate how much it matters if we only have a small sample of 
data to work with rather than the whole picture.

### Background

Usually we are not in the happy situation of having a massive dataset and only 
wanting to look at part of it. In this context, it turns out that some 
diversity measures are very sensitive to the amount of data that has been
collected, and so if you want to compare two populations to identify the more
diverse, you may need to subsample the larger dataset to the size of the smaller
one to make a fair comparison.

## Tasks

There are several ways of subsampling a population like the one we have here. The 
simplest way to **approximate** the process is to use `rmultinom()` to generate 
a small dataset with appropriate probabilities as we did in Project 1 to create 
`rand.pop`.

### Function to subsample by individuals

Write and document a function (like the `sample_by_species`, *etc.* functions
that we provided for you in your data package) to subsample a dataset to a given
size called `sample_by_individuals()` (perhaps using this `rmultinom`
function) -- it should take a vector of population counts and a sample size as
its arguments and return a vector of sample counts. Note this is slightly
different from the `sample_...()` functions that we provided that take the whole
`bci_2010` dataset as an argument (a matrix, not a vector). 

Incidentally, can you work out why this is only an approximation? Can you think 
of a better solution? This is not easy (or we can't see how to do it easily 
anyway!), so don't worry if you just use the suggested method. If you can work 
out what's wrong, put an explanation into the documentation for the function.

## Demo

Now create a new demo. For each dataset that has the full number of individuals
(*i.e.* not `quadrat.pop`, `quadrat10.pop` or `rand50.pop`), plot the diversity
profile of the full dataset, and then plot the diversity profile of a subsample
of 10 individuals, then 100, 1000, 10000, and so on until you reach the full
population size. See what effect sample size has on diversity for different
values of `q`. At this point you have two choices:

**Either** (a more qualitative, graphical project) look at plots of the full 
dataset, and then multiple repeats of, say, 100 or 1000 individuals and see how 
variable your answers are with small samples, investigating issues arising from 
not collecting enough data.

**Or alternatively** (a more analytical project) you could choose to run 
analyses on the different populations and subsamples of them, and then repeat 
the same analyses on the exact same populations and subsamples using our 
`rdiversity` package and compare the results numerically (as in Project 3, 
remember that you can test whether two numbers are approximately equal to each 
other using `if (abs(x-y) < 0.000001)`) to ensure they give the same results.
